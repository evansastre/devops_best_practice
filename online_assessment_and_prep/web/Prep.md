## Nameserver (NS)
S records look something like this.

andy.ns.cloudflare.com
dave.ns.cloudflare.com
You normally have at least 2 NS records.

They look like a website URL, but Instead of linking to a website, they link to the domain names authoritative nameservers.

The authoritative nameservers store most of your DNS records with a few exceptions such as NS and glue records.

## A record, also known as IPv4 address record
The A record is used to point the domain name at one or multiple IP addresses.
